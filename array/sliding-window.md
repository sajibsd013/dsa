The **sliding window** is a popular technique used in algorithms to optimize the performance of problems involving arrays, lists, or strings. It works by maintaining a window (a subset of elements) that moves incrementally over the data to process it efficiently.

This technique is often used in problems involving **subarrays**, **subsequences**, or **substrings**, where the goal is to find the maximum, minimum, or some other property of a subset within a certain size.

### Steps of the Sliding Window Technique:
1. Define a window (typically represented by two pointers, `start` and `end`).
2. Expand the window by moving the `end` pointer to include more elements.
3. Shrink the window by moving the `start` pointer to discard unnecessary elements.
4. Update the desired result during these operations.

### Example Problem: Maximum Sum of a Subarray of Size `k`

#### Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers and a number `k`, find the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`.

#### Code in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int maxSumSubarray(int arr[], int n, int k) {
    // Check if the array size is smaller than k
    if (n < k) {
        printf("Invalid input: array size is smaller than subarray size.\n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Calculate the sum of the first window of size k
    int max_sum = 0, window_sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        window_sum += arr[i];
    }

    max_sum = window_sum;

    // Slide the window over the array
    for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
        // Slide the window: subtract the element going out and add the element coming in
        window_sum += arr[i] - arr[i - k];
        // Update the maximum sum
        if (window_sum > max_sum) {
            max_sum = window_sum;
        }
    }

    return max_sum;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
    int k = 3; // Size of the subarray
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    int result = maxSumSubarray(arr, n, k);
    if (result != -1) {
        printf("Maximum sum of a subarray of size %d is: %d\n", k, result);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points:
1. **Initialization:** Start with the sum of the first window.
2. **Sliding the Window:** As the window slides (by moving one index forward), update the sum efficiently by subtracting the element that goes out of the window and adding the element that comes into the window.
3. **Optimization:** Instead of recalculating the sum for every window from scratch, use the previous window's sum.

### Applications of Sliding Window:
1. **Finding the longest substring with at most `k` distinct characters**.
2. **Checking for anagrams in a string**.
3. **Solving problems with fixed or variable-sized subarrays/substrings**.
4. **Maximum or minimum in a sliding window (e.g., stock prices)**.
